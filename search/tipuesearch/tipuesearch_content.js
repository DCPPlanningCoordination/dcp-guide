This brief offers a concise look at job growth across a wide range of sectors, and where these jobs are located around NYC. Employment in NYC's Manufacturing Districts: This report examines recent employment trends in NYC's industrial areas. Its quantitative insights will help the City implement its 10-point Industrial Action Plan announced by Mayor de Blasio in November 2015. Various data for 2000, 2008, 2010 and 2014 showed high growth in both industrial and other jobs in the manufacturing (M) districts outside Manhattan. Although net non-industrial-sector jobs grew more from 2000-2014, M Districts remain predominantly industrial, particularly in Industrial Business Zones.Recent Employment Patterns in NYC: This 2016 analysis looks at recent trends in employment patterns in NYC, and documents a decades-long shift towards the services industry. In post-recession NYC, 500,000 private sector jobs have been added and the unemployment rate is on pace to be at a record 40-year low. And the growth is diverse, both in terms of the types of jobs and location of the jobs, in almost every neighborhood in all five boroughs. These data provide an important context for developing public policy and aligning land use planning with economic growth. NYC Hotel Market Analysis: This 2017 report presents an overview of the hotel industry in New York City over the last decade, as well as current and projected future conditions. It is intended to provide guidance to the New York City Department of Planning regarding the potential impacts of imposing a Special Permit for hotel development in M1 zoning districts. It analyzes trends related to hotel development patterns and typologies, demand drivers, occupancy and revenue, and the projected development pipeline for new hotel construction and delivery, with a particular focus on future development in those M1 areas. Going to Market: This 2008 study identified a widespread shortage of grocery stores and supermarkets in New York City neighborhoods, diagnosed some causes of the shortage, and made recommendations for encouraging new grocery stores in neighborhoods that need them. The report's findings informed the FRESH Program.",

It is produced by the Census Bureau using administrative jobs records similar to the QCEW data below, and aggregated to protect confidentiality. This data is available through OnTheMap, an interactive data and mapping tool linked below. Census Transportation Planning Products (CTPP): The CTPP is a set of special tabulations of the ACS journey-to-work questions designed for transportation and economic planning. Data are available for residence, workplace, and commuting flows. Because the CTPP is based on survey data, it is representative of the full universe of workers, including government and off-the books workers who are not counted in LEHD and QCEW data. It also contains high sampling variability for small areas. The most current CTPP data tables are based on 2006-2010 ACS data and are available for different levels of geographic resolution ranging from States to census tracts.Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) (Public): The QCEW program utilizes employment and wage data reported quarterly by all employers subject to unemployment insurance requirements. Data are available at the county, MSA, State, and national levels by detailed NAICS industry. Data products include summary tabulations of the number of establishments, number of employees, and total and average wages paid. Consult the data documentation for help with use and interpretation. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) (Confidential): This confidential dataset is only available to economic researchers at DCP who have been trained in disclosure regulations. It is used to conduct detailed economic studies on very specific industries, obtain information about employment in specific land use and zoning types, and business births and deaths. If your project requires confidential QCEW data, contact Nick Moore of HEIP. NYMTC Socioeconomic and Demographic Forecasts: The New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) produces small area population and employment projections every four years which are used for transportation models and planning. These projections were created in close collaboration between DCP, NYMTC, and NYMTC’s economic consultant.",

While these profiles only provide data for characteristics of the residential population, as opposed to employment at the place of work, it is still useful in finding economic characteristics of residents, such as labor force participation, means of transportation to work, and income. NYC Metro Region Explorer: This tool, produced by DCP’s Regional Planning Division and Planning Labs, is an interactive map showing population, housing, and employment trends within the tri-state New York City metropolitan region, and shares key insights about how the region has changed from 2000 to today. The platform will be maintained as part of DCP’s ongoing commitment to help the public access and understand information about planning issues affecting NYC and the metro region. Data are available for download as shapefiles and as CSV files. OnTheMap (US Census Bureau):OnTheMap is the Census Bureau's interactive map of where people work and where workers live. This tool allows users to view employment and commuting statistics from the LEHD-LODES data (described above) for custom geographies down to Census blocks from 2002 to 2015. OnTheMap should be your first stop in determining total private payroll employment for areas smaller than counties. Caution: Public sector employment data is available in OnTheMap, but it is extremely unreliable in NYC. Only private employment (in the job type filter) should be reported from the tool. Map Reliability Calculator: American Community Survey (ACS) estimates are derived from a survey, and such statistics are subject to sampling error—divergence from the actual characteristics of the surveyed population. Sampling error can significantly undermine the representativeness of maps. This calculator evaluates your ACS data, its margins of error, and your proposed class breaks, and determines the probability that geographic units are misclassified due to sampling error. For further guidance, the calculator subjects your proposed class breaks to a reliability test. If there is less than a 10% chance of erroneously classified geographies among all mapped categories, and less than a 20% chance of misclassification for each individual category, your map passes the test and is suitable for general use.",

This dataset is now complemented with the Facilities Explorer, a new interactive web map that makes the data more accessible and allows users to quickly filter the data for their needs. A FacDB layer file is available in M:\GIS\DATA\BYTES of the BIG APPLE\City Facilities\City Planning Facilities Database. Capital Projects Database (CPDB): CPDB captures key data points on potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects sponsored or managed by a capital agency in and around NYC based on the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) three times per year; therefore, only the capital projects that appear in NYC’s Capital Commitment Plan are reflected in CPDB. This database supports the most comprehensive map of potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects taking place across NYC enabling Planners to better understand and communicate New York City’s capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. This integrated but not exhaustive view provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and a starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning. City Owned and Leased Property (COLP): This database captures the use and agency jurisdictions for all City owned or leased property required under Section 204 of the City Charter.

This tool is designed to enable more informed decision-making by DCP staff, NYC residents, property and business owners, architects and engineers, and policy-makers. Flood Risk Atlases: DCP's Resilient Neighborhoods initiative helps communities identify zoning and land use changes to support neighborhood vitality and help residents and businesses withstand and recover quickly from future storms and flooding. These story maps show the range of flood risks and impacts of extreme weather in those communities. Waterfront Revitalization Program Map: The New York City Waterfront Revitalization Program (WRP) establishes the City’s policies for waterfront planning, preservation, and development projects to ensure consistency over the long term. This map identifies the Coastal Zone, ecologically sensitive areas, and other designations important to determining a project's consistency with the WRP. Learn more about the WRP here. Floodplain Construction Map: The Floodplain Construction map was created to allow planners to view and update records on floodplain building construction remotely or during field visits. This map is for internal DCP use only.
